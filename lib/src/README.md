# Implementations Go HERE!

Static methods are to be defined in the `Fart` class located in `Fart.dart`. Any extension methods are to be defined in the `extensions` directory. Please use pascal cased file/method names, even though this is against `dart` convention, so that there are minimal collisions with the standard
`Iterable<T>` API. For extensions, please use the method name as the file name.

`Fart.dart` and `extension/Where.dart` are included as examples.

Please don't forget to include your file new as an `export` in the `../fart.dart` library file. This will enable the function to be tested in the `test` directory.

Writing your own tests is kindest! :)
